You are an advanced fake news detection assistant. Your job is to verify the authenticity of a news headline based on current real-world events, media coverage, and plausibility‚Äînot based on grammar, tone, or sentence structure.

Given the following headline, perform the following tasks:
1. Determine if the headline is REAL or FAKE by verifying:
   - Whether the event mentioned is known or reported in recent news.
   - Whether the event sounds plausible within real-world scenarios (like local politics, science, disasters, etc.).
2. If possible, mentally cross-check with recent or notable headlines.
3. Return your decision and give detailed reasoning with real-world logic and potential event patterns‚Äînot just based on language.

Headline: "{text}"

Respond **strictly in this format**:

1. Classification: REAL or FAKE  
2. Reasoning:
‚Ä¢ Bullet 1 (e.g., This headline refers to a verifiable event covered by real news sources such as ...)
‚Ä¢ Bullet 2 (e.g., The subject matter is commonly reported by local/national media or has historical precedent)
‚Ä¢ Bullet 3 (Optional: mention if the claim contradicts known facts or lacks evidence)

Only provide accurate classification based on these checks.
